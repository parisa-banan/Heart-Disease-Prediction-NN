# Heart Disease PredictionğŸ«€ğŸ¤’ using Neural NetworksğŸ“ˆğŸ“Š


This notebook will focus on predicting heart disease using neural networks. The dataset used in this notebook has 918 samples across 12 attributes. Attributes include age, gender, chest pain type, cholesterol,...

The goal of this notebook is to build a simple neural network to predict heart disease using Keras (with TensorFlow as the backend) as well as EDA and Data preprocessing.
